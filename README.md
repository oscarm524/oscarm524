Hello there,

My name is Oscar Aguilar. I'm originally from Peru, and I'm a fan of applied mathematics. 

I'm a data scientist in the asset management industry and an assistant professor of analytics. I’m interested in applied statistics, machine learning and math-finance. In my spare time, I'm in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/oscarm524).
