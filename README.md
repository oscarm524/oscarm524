Hello there,

My name is Oscar Aguilar. I'm originally from Peru; I moved to USA when I was 18 years old. I'm a fan of applied mathematics. I'm a data scientist at [Macquarie Group](https://www.macquarie.com/us/en.html) and an assistant professor of analytics at [Grand View University](https://www.grandview.edu/). I’m interested in applied statistics, machine learning and math-finance.
